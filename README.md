## Hi there, I'm Florian

I am a Data Scientist and Python developer with a strong mathematical background. Always looking to apply mathematics to real-world problems and enthusiastic about everything math.

As Head of Data Science at [inovex GmbH](https://www.inovex.de/en/), I enjoy working on innovative Data Science & Data Engineering projects with experts every day. In my spare time, I like to contribute to several OSS projects in the PyData stack and started the [PyScaffold project](https://github.com/pyscaffold) to foster and establish best practices and clean coding within the Python ecosystem.
